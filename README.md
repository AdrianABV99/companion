# companion

Companion is an basic program that once runned can recive voice commands from you!
you can ask companion about his name, you can ask it to open your browser(only chrome) or to open your text editor(only sublime).
Also companion can look up on internet for you the answer for different questions like:age of your favorite celebrity, heigh of everest,
distance to the moon and many more!(not that many)
